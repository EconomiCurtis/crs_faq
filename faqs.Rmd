## How do I choose a solution?

If your question has been answered, would you mind marking the solution? That way, someone in the future can come along and easily see what worked for you.

If you're the OP (as you were in this case), there should be a little box at the bottom of replies that you can click to select that response as your "solution." 

_Example from one of my questions, below:_

## How do I change categories?

When changing the category for a question, you will not lose anything. The thread stays the same. All you need to do is click the pencil icon next to the post title, and then use the dropdown to select a different category.
